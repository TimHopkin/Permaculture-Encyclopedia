- **UN SDG connections** showing global relevance

## Technical Implementation
- New `/case-studies` page with individual case study routes
- Interactive filtering system
- Video embed capabilities for Andrew's documentation
- Mobile-optimised cards and layouts
- Search functionality within case studies

## Integration Points
- Add "Case Studies" to main navigation
- Cross-link from Techniques page ("See this in action...")
- Reference from Getting Started page ("Learn from success stories...")
- Connect to Resources page with Andrew's educational content

## Implementation Status
- **Status**: Planned for future implementation
- **Priority**: High (after branding refresh)
- **Dependencies**: Complete website branding refresh first
- **Resources**: Andrew Millison's YouTube documentation, research data collected
